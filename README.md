# Calculeightor

An interface, a GUI implementation and a CLI implementation walked into a bar...

This is intended to showcase two different implementations for a calculator interface. 

It's not so much calculator-centric, but it expects a stream of numeric values,
and a `BinaryOperator` to reduce it to a single result (hence, the calculation).
